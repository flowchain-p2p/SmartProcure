Generate seed data under the 'utils' folder for testing a MongoDB application.

Models are defined in the 'models' folder.

1. Create a tenant named "MRF".

2. Set the tenant admin email address to "admin@mrf.com".

3. default password for all user is Password@123 , ( Always hased befoere save , refe existing user Creation logic if needed)

3. Create 6 user . Each user should:
   - Have the default role (refer to the 'system role' definition in the models).
   - Refer utils/seedPermissionsAndRoles.js for default permissions mappings 
   - A cost center (generate a few distinct cost center names, e.g., "Manufacturing Operations", "Sales & Marketing", "Corporate Administration", "Research & Development").
   - A department (generate a few distinct department names, e.g., "Engineering Department", "Marketing Department", "Finance Department", "Human Resources", "IT Department", "Production Department", "Logistics Department").
   - A location (since the current location is Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, use "Chennai" and perhaps one or two other plausible locations within India, e.g., "Bangalore", "Mumbai", "Delhi").

Ensure the Create seed.js so that i can run and start testing this 

Do not modify any existing code. The generated seed data should be placed within a new file or set of files under the 'util' folder.
